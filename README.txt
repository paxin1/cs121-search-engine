How to run this program:
First you will need to generate your indexes. Run either the generate_index.py or search.py program, and make sure the DEV folder has the same parent directory as generate_index.py.
This will build the indexes. these files are quite large, and can take some time to create, so patience is key.

Once the indexes are built, you can begin to search. enter your query into the prompt and the results should appear in under 300 ms.
